## Only steps not shown:

* Create a new directory for the project and name it whatever, in this case it is called `5lines-of-webhost`.
* Start vscode with the new directory as the project root.

Lets begin.

1. Create a npm project using `npm init`.

2. Install expressjs server using `npm install express`

3. Once that is done we create our directory where the site files will be hosted from.

4. Now we will write our 5 lines of code.

5. Run the web server using `node app` in the comman line, whatever it maybe.

> Note worthy is that none of this will work if Nodejs is not installed in your environment.

6. And that is that, as a bonus step, we add a script to the package.json for convenience.

I thank you kindly.
